I did this project to test my theoretical knowledge of gradient descent in deep learning. I created Gaussian-distributed noise centered in different points of a 2D plane and attempted using gradient descent to distinguish the two groups. This mini project is divided into four parts.
1. Two scatters and no hidden layers
2. Three scatters and no hidden layers
3. Three scatters and 2 hidden layers with sigmoid activation functions and sigmoid output function
4. Three scatters and 2 hidden layers with sigmoid activation function and softmax output function
